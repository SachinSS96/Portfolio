**Data Pipeline**: Constructed an end-to-end pipeline using AWS S3 and Snowflake for seamless data storage and analysis.

**Data Cleaning**: Implemented SQL-based cleaning processes to ensure data integrity before ingestion.

**Visualization**: Created dynamic dashboards in Power BI, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.



### [Healthcare Cost Analysis Using Insurance Data](https://nbviewer.org/github/SachinSS96/Portfolio/blob/main/Python/Insurance/Insurance_EDA_Hypothesis_Testing.ipynb)

**Overview**: Analyzed insurance data to understand factors affecting healthcare costs. Conducted data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and hypothesis testing to derive insights.

**Methods and Techniques**: Outlier detection, hypothesis testing (t-tests), visualization techniques.

**Results and Insights**: Identified correlations between age and charges, as well as differences in charges between smokers and non-smokers. Provided recommendations for promoting healthy living and awareness around smoking cessation.

**Role and Contribution**: Led data analysis, performed statistical tests, and generated visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
 

### [Credit Card Transaction Analysis ](https://github.com/SachinSS96/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL/credit_card_transcations/credit_card_transcations.sql)

**Overview**: Analyzed credit card transaction data to derive insights into spending patterns, identify trends, and optimize business strategies.

**Methods**: Developed SQL queries to perform various analyses, including identifying top spending cities, determining highest spend months by card type, and analyzing transaction details for specific criteria.

**Techniques Used**: Aggregation, ranking, filtering, and cumulative calculations were employed to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.

**Outcomes**: Generated actionable insights such as identifying top spending cities, highest spend months for different card types, and analyzing spending patterns by expense type and gender.

**Impact**: Provided valuable insights to stakeholders for strategic decision-making, targeting marketing efforts, and optimizing business processes.
